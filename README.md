This project involves creating an interactive number guessing game in Java. The game generates a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100. The player is then prompted to guess the number, receiving feedback on whether their guess is correct, too high, or too low. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number or exhausts a limited number of attempts.

Additional features include:

Attempt Limitation: Players are given a finite number of attempts to guess the correct number.
Multiple Rounds: Players can choose to play multiple rounds, with their performance tracked across each round.
Scoring System: A score is calculated based on the number of attempts taken to guess correctly or rounds won, providing an additional competitive element to the game.
